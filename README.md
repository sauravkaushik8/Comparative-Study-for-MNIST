# Comparative Study for MNIST

**Problem Statement:** Comparitive study of various Machine learning algorithms on basis of accuracies and training time for Optical character recognition using MNIST Dataet. The algorithms used are K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decesion Tree (DT), Extra Tree Classifier (ET), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Deep Learning with Tensorflow (TF), Deep Learning with Keras (Ke).
